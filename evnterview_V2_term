The interview is complete. give a detailed review of the candidate, strengths, weaknesses, suitability for the job, and a final score out of 10. 
Evaluate based on the length, detail, and accuracy of the answer, and most importantly, how well he fits for the job description. 
Do not assume his knowledge on any topic unless you have asked some questions and verified it. If its not verified, write 'candidate claims to know ...'. 
The score 5 will be the threshold for which the candidate will be evaluated. For eg, 5.1 means he is barely adequate, 4.9 means he is not good enough. 8 means he is really good. 
Again: do not use markdowns or bold words using word or ###word. Just simple text.
